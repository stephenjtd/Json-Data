She prefers to look right at the things nobody else can bring themselves to mention: for example, the fact that her beloved older sister is dead, pushed in front of a train by a man still on the loose. Her grief-stricken parents have basically been sleepwalking ever since, and it is Mathilda's sworn mission to shock them back to life. Her strategy? Being bad.\n\nMathilda decides she's going to figure out what lies behind the catastrophe. She starts sleuthing through her sister's most secret possessions--emails, clothes, notebooks, whatever her determination and craftiness can ferret out. In a storyline that thrums with hints of ancient myth, Mathilda has to risk a great deal - in fact, has to leave behind everything she loves - in order to discover the truth.\n\n\"Mathilda Savitch\" bursts with unforgettably imagined details: impossible crushes, devastating humiliations, the way you can hate and love your family at the same moment, the times when you and your best friend are so weak with laughter that you can't breathe. Startling, funny, touching, odd, truthful, page-turning, and, in the end, heartbreaking, \"Mathilda Savitch\" is an extraordinary debut. Once you make the acquaintance of Mathilda Savitch, you will never forget her."},

Small-town Mabel Dagmar has never known anyone like Ev, and now she’s sharing her college dorm – even if she is completely ignored. But suddenly they’re friends and Mabel can hardly believe her luck when she finds herself summering at the Winslow family’s luxurious estate, Winloch, in Vermont.\n\nWinloch is like a small village, with each of the perfect Winslow children inhabiting a pretty white cottage. Days spent swimming in watery coves evaporate into nights at glamorous cocktail parties where Mabel sits alongside the scions and the fountainhead of this prestigious family. And as the formality melts away with one particular Winslow brother, Mabel is left to think that her summer has all but become a golden dream.\n\nBut when Mabel meets a disgruntled member of the family, she can’t help looking a little closer at the Winslows, probing beneath their glossy exterior. And what she uncovers in their past is almost as shocking as what she finds out about their present. Beneath the beauty is a rotten core.\n\nAnd not everyone is quite as they seem."}

No wonder Carla Lemarchant sought the best help available, and it was fortunate for her that she found Hercule Poirot, for as he said himself, “Rest assured—I am the best.” Faced with the question: Did Carla’s mother, Caroline Crale, really commit the murder for which she was sentenced? he began to reconstruct in his mind events long past. She was an enigmatic character, this Caroline Crale, who had pleaded innocent yet had not fought to prove it. Her life with Amyas Crale had been difficult, certainly. He was selfish, quarrelsome, inconsiderate and unfaithful, even though he was a great painter as some said. Approaching deftly and tactfully the other five people involved in the case, Poirot unravels bit by bit the true story of that summer day sixteen years ago. It is a fascinating story which leaves the reader to marvel more than ever at Poirot’s performance and to acclaim Mrs. Christie for yet another brilliant landmark in the history of detective fiction."}

The eccentric group who satirised trad jazz, pop and rock, reached Number five with ‘I’m The Urban Spaceman’ in 1968. A punishing schedule of tours and television followed, including work with the future Monty Python team. The following year, broke and burned out, the Bonzos split up, leaving behind a loyal cult following.\n\n\nVivian launched into myriad solo projects in music, film and theatre, giving himself several nervous breakdowns in the process. His comic masterpiece, ‘Sir Henry at Rawlinson End’, was heard in radio, on an album, and then hit the big screen. Vivian wrote the musical ‘Stinkfoot’, was narrator on ‘Tubular Bells’ and provided lyrics for Steve Winwood. In person, he was just as multi-faceted, by turns the erudite artist and the truculent Teddy Boy, breathtakingly rude. A powerful figure, tall, red-haired and never less than extravagant in his fashion, Vivian Stanshall was a hell-raiser of legendary reputation – ably assisted through much of the 1970s by Who drummer Keith Moon. Vivian drove the many who loved him to the limit, struggling with terrible tranquilliser and alcohol dependency. He died at home in a house fire in 1995. The story of his turbulent life is utterly compelling."}

As the people braved starvation, bitter cold, and a relentless German onslaught, Marina joined other staff members in removing the museum's priceless masterpieces for safekeeping, leaving the frames hanging empty on the walls to symbolize the artworks' eventual return. As the Luftwaffe's bombs pounded the proud, stricken city, Marina built a personal Hermitage in her mind—a refuge that would stay buried deep within her, until she needed it once more."}

With the help of his psychiatric patient Harvey - who believes himself to be a secret agent who can control the weather - Leo attempts to unravel the mystery of the spousal-switch, the secret workings of The Royal Society of Meteorology in their cosmic conflict with the 49 Quantum Fathers, the enigmatic guidance of Dr. Tzvi Gal-Chen, and how he, or maybe his wife, or perhaps even Harvey, is at the centre of it all. From the streets of New York to the southernmost reaches of Patagonia, Leo's erratic quest ultimately becomes a test of how far he is willing to take his struggle against the uncontested truth he knows to be false.\n\nAtmospheric Disturbances investigates the moment of crisis when you suddenly understand that the reality you insist upon is no longer one you can accept, the person you love has been somehow reduced to merely the person you live with, and how you spend your life trying to weather the storms of your own making."},

She was anxious that she might turn into an author, a fate incompatible – for a woman – with respectability.\n\nHer hope was in vain. Not only was she to write four novels (‘Evelina’, ‘Cecilia’, ‘Camilla’ and ‘The Wanderer’), all of which are still in print, she also kept a voluminous diary for the next seventy years and was a prolific letter-writer. Daughter of the eminent music historian Dr Charles Burney; friend of Sheridan, Garrick, Burke and Johnson; second keeper of the robes to George III’s Queen Charlotte; wife to a refugee French aristocrat; detained for ten years in revolutionary France; horrified witness of the aftermath of Waterloo; victim of a mastectomy without anaesthetic…Fanny Burney’s life was as eventful as any novel."}

A unique memoir, 'Madame Depardieu and the Beautiful Strangers' is the story of how a young female film critic's love-life is affected and nearly ruined by her obsession with male movie stars. As her increasingly hapless hunt for the right man unfolds and her television and newspaper career unravels, our heroine finally begins to understand that difficult truth: that life is not like the movies. Entwined with the narrative of her real-life love affairs is a kaleidoscope of digressions on great screen actors -- her dream-life with Gerard Depardieu, a personal ad seeking out Tom Cruise, a disastrous climactic encounter with Jeff Bridges. It's a helter skelter ride through love and the movies which reads like a screwball comedy. And the screwball is our heroine, who seems to know everything about movies and the human heart, and nothing about anything else. Written in a fresh and utterly engaging voice, 'Madame Depardieu and the Beautiful Strangers' is both moving and hilarious, a bittersweet and endearingly honest one-off."},

In the collection's title story Monique attempts to piece together the remnants of her former life after her husband confesses to an affair with a younger woman. In \"The Monologue\" a rich and spoilt woman is consumed with bitterness and loneliness after her son and husband have left home. In \"The Age of Discretion\" a scholar faces the harsh rejection of her latest academic work and the waning love of a son more interested in his young wife and her worldly values.\n\nFull of wit and compassion, de Beauvoir's analysis is unsurpassable: enthralling as fiction, essential as an insight into the complexities of women's lives."},

As military technology evolved to produce lighter, and quieter firearms that could strike with accuracy over longer and longer distances, so the role of the talented individual marksman has become more central to the outcome of military conflicts. Andy Dougan tells the story of the sniper as seen in the wars of Vietnam, the first and Second World Wars, the American Civil War, the Boer War and European conflicts and up to the present day when the sniper is not only a battlefield phenomenon but a terrorist in civilian society of almost phantom-like elusiveness. other military history, been the story of individuals: of high profile victims such as the Union General Sedgwick, whose legendary last words were 'They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance' to the celebrated shooters.

And nothing can protect him from obsession-both with a woman, who seems in her silence and mystery to possess the power to destroy his life forever, and with the weather kite he designs to fly higher than any kite has ever flown before, a kite with which Bigelow plans to penetrate and know not just the sky but the heavens.\n\nA novel of passions both dangerous and generative, The Seal Wife explores the nature of desire and its ability to propel an individual beyond himself and outside conventions.

As his captain steers his precious cargo – but not his crew – to safety through a raging, swelling storm and onward to the riches of the uncharted African coast, Martin comes to realize that down deeper lie secrets, desires and freedoms of uncanny power.\n\n\nThe laws seem different out on the ocean, criss-crossing the Mediterranean or hugging Africa’s shore, couriering yachts or cocaine, trafficking in spices or more human contraband. Living outside the dry land’s dry laws is liberating, but, as Martin discovers, the lawgivers and the lawkeepers always turn up, looking for their justice.\n\n\nChristopher Wallace, the prize-winning author of The Pied Piper’s Poison and The Resurrection Club, tells an exhilarating pair of stories that reflect off each other like the sun off the ..."}

After two thousand years, the human race may be given a second chance.\n\nWhen Joshua moves to a small cabin on the edge of town, the local people are mystified by his presence. A quiet and simple man, Joshua appears to seek nothing for himself. He supports himself by working as a carpenter. He charges very little for his services, yet his craftsmanship is exquisite. The statue of Moses that he carves for the local synagogue prompts amazement as well as consternation.\n\nWhat are the townsfolk to make of this enigmatic stranger? Some people report having seen him carry a huge cherry log on his shoulders effortlessly. Still others talk about the child in a poor part of town who was dreadfully ill but, after Joshua’s visit, recovered completely.\n\nDespite his benevolence and selfless work in the community, some remain suspicious. Finally, in an effort to address the community’s doubts, Joshua is confronted by the local church leaders."}

The mini cab office was up a cobbled mews with little flat houses either side. That's where I first met Violet Park, what was left of her. There was a healing centre next door, a pretty smart name for a place with a battered brown door and no proper door handle and stuck-on wooden numbers in the shape of clowns. The 3 of number 13 was a w stuck on sideways and I thought it was kind of sad and I liked it at the same time. Sixteen-year-old Lucas Swain becomes intrigued by the urn of ashes left in a cab office. Convinced that its occupant -- Violet Park -- is communicating with him, he contrives to gain possession of the urn, little realising that his quest will take him on a voyage of self-discovery and identity, forcing him to finally confront what happened to his absent (and possibly dead) father!"},

As if the streets weren't scary enough, the looming war between the two men in her life explodes, taking even more casualties and putting Chess squarely in the middle. Downside could become a literal ghost town if Chess doesn't find a way to stop both the war and the dark wave of death-magic, and the only way to do that is to use both her addiction and her power to enter the spell and chase the magic all the way back to its malevolent source.

Everyday experience cannot prepare us for the sub-atomic world, where quantum effects become all-important. Here, particles can look like waves, and vice versa; electrons seem to lose their identity and instead take on a shifting, unpredictable appearance that depends on how they are being observed; and a single photon may sometimes behave as if it could be in two places at once. In the world of quantum mechanics, uncertainty and ambiguity become not just unavoidable, but essential ingredients of science—a development so disturbing that to Einstein ”it was as if God were playing dice with the universe.” And there is no one better able to explain the quantum revolution as it approaches the century mark than David Lindley. He brings the quantum revolution full circle, showing how the familiar and trustworthy reality of the world around us is actually a consequence of the ineffable uncertainty of the subatomic quantum world—the world we can't see."}

In 1897, in a remote area of Alabama called Mitcham Beat, an aspiring politician is mysteriously murdered. His outraged supporters form the Hell at the Breech gang -- and wage a bloody campaign of retribution that sweeps up the guilty and the innocent alike. Caught in this maelstrom of vengeance are the county's ageing sheriff, the widowed midwife who delivered nearly every member of the gang, a ruthless detective waging a private war, and a young store clerk with a terrible secret. Soaked in the atmosphere of the Deep South, Tom Franklin weaves together historical fact, spare, poised prose and brutal, vivid action to tell a powerful story of ordinary people testing their capacity for good and evil in a harsh and lawless land -- in so doing writing a novel worthy of comparison to the works of William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor and James Dickey."},

Best known as the author of GULLIVERS TRAVELS, he was an ordained clergyman whose enemies thought did not believe in God. He became a legendary Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, whose ambition for church perferment in Englandwas perpetually frustrated. For four short, intoxicating years he was the intimate of Queen Anne's chief ministers - a 'spin-doctor' before the term was invented. His private life was intense and enigmatic Two younger women whom he called Stella and Vanessa, moved to Ireland to be close to him. He made both of them unhappy. Poet, polemicist, pamphleteer and wit, Swift is the master of shock. His furious satirical responses to the corruption and hypocrisy he saw around him in public and private life have every relevance for our own artifice and civilisation, gave a new adjective - Swiftian -to the lexicon of criticism. Victoria Glendinning, prize-winning biographer, investigates at close range the main events and relationships of Swift's life, providing a compelling and provocative portrait set in a rich tapestry of controversy and paradox."},

D. James, long among the most admired mystery writers of our time, draws the characters of Jane Austen’s beloved novel Pride and Prejudice into a tale of murder and emotional mayhem.\n\nIt is 1803, six years since Elizabeth and Darcy embarked on their life together at Pemberley, Darcy’s magnificent estate. Their peaceful, orderly world seems almost unassailable. Elizabeth has found her footing as the chatelaine of the great house. They have two fine sons, Fitzwilliam and Charles. Elizabeth’s sister Jane and her husband, Bingley, live nearby; her father visits often; there is optimistic talk about the prospects of marriage for Darcy’s sister Georgiana. And preparations are under way for their much-anticipated annual autumn ball.\n\nThen, on the eve of the ball, the patrician idyll is shattered. A coach careens up the drive carrying Lydia, Elizabeth’s disgraced sister, who with her husband, the very dubious Wickham, has been banned from Pemberley. She stumbles out of the carriage, hysterical, shrieking that Wickham has been murdered. With shocking suddenness, Pemberley is plunged into a frightening mystery.\n\nInspired by a lifelong passion for Austen, P. D. James masterfully re-creates the world of Pride and Prejudice, electrifying it with the excitement and suspense of a brilliantly crafted crime story, as only she can write it."}

Born in Dublin in 1975. Davoren was able to control very little of his body, and mute of speech, was assessed as mentally handicapped until age seven. Learning to communicate first by using a letter-board while sitting on his mother, Brighid's lap, he began to write poetry which received wide critical acclaim in Ireland and Britain. Davoren Hanna's first book, Not Common Speech, was published by Raven Arts Press in 1990, and an RTE television documentary 'Poised for Flight' was made on his life and work. Then in July 1990, his mother Brighid, who cradled him into life and speech, died suddenly, and four years later Davoren, after a series of health crises, died peacefully in his sleep in July 1994."},

Fitting the requirements of the National Literacy Strategy, National Curriculum in England and Wales, English Language 5-14 in Scotland, and Common Curriculum in Northern Ireland, the Oxford Literacy Web guides pupils through the core skills associated with learning to read and write with a diverse range of literary styles within the genres of fiction, non-fiction, rhymes, language, and poetry. The \"Fiction\" strand: there can be no better way to learn to read than through the Duck Green School and Variety story strands. Exciting stories, hilarious events, and dynamic illustrations combine to ensure diversity and enjoyment. In the Duck Green School stories, early school experiences are brought to life through a cast of lovable characters. Children can enjoy their own `soap opera' while learning specific vocabulary in context. In the Stage 3Duck Green Stories, we continue to read about Mrs Best's reception class and learn more about the Year 1 class and their teacher, Mr Jelly, while Cheep the baby bird finds a friend in Josh. This level introduces a greater variety both in layout and types of text, including more rhyming stories. The books are available in both standard and `big book' format."},
