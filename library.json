		"Description": "In October 1996 the national newspapers began to report the disappearance of the Bishop of Argyll who had been missing for ten days. He eventually reappeared in the North of England supported by a woman with whom he had been having a relationship. When the news broke another woman disclosed that she too had been involved with the bishop and had given birth to his child. Roddy Wright is the first Roman Catholic bishop to have resigned in Britain under such circumstances. While the press have not stopped hounding him and his partner, Roddy Wright has given no interviews and made no public appearances. Here, he tells his own story, set against the background of a childhood in the tenements of Glasgow and his life as a young priest in the Highlands of Scotland."

As the clock ticks remorselessly towards Zero Hour and the return of Dracula, the devastated remnants of Department 19 try to hold back the rising darkness. Jamie Carpenter is training new recruits, trying to prepare them for a fight that appears increasingly futile. Kate Randall is pouring her grief into trying to plug the Departments final leaks, as Matt Browning races against time to find a cure for vampirism. And on the other side of the world, Larissa Kinley has found a place she feels at home, yet where she makes a startling discovery. Uneasy truces are struck, new dangers emerge on all sides, and relationships are pushed to breaking point. And in the midst of it all, Department 19 faces a new and potentially deadly threat, born out of one of the darkest moments of its own long and bloody history. Zero Hour is coming. And the Battle Lines have been drawn."

She buys a penny twist of coloured sugar and settles down to watch the heart-stopping main attraction: a lion, billed as a monster from the savage heart of Africa, forged in the heat of a merciless sun. Mama swears she hears the lion sigh, just before it leaps...and when Eve is born, the story goes, she didnt cry - she meowed and licked her paws. When Abel is pulled from the stinking Thames, the mudlarks are sure he is long dead. As they search his pockets to divvy up the treasure, his eyes crack open and he coughs up a stream of black water. But how has he survived a week in that thick stew of human waste? Cast out by Victorian society, Eve and Abel find succour from an unlikely source. They will become The Lion Faced Girl and The Flayed Man, star performers in Professor Josiah Arroners Palace of Curiosities. And there begins a journey that will entwine their fates forever."

His intense loyalties are to his parents, to his wife and children, to the family firm and the trade it practises, to his native south-east London and to his best friend Curly, traffic wonk and surviving brother of his former best friend who fell to his death at Norwood Junction. Well into middle age, and Henry’s life is running smoothly as he always hoped it would. But then: his wife’s tennis partner, a celebrity florist and BBC2 star is accidentally beheaded by his electric hedgecutter while crimping a three metre high topiary poodle; Curly, newly married and eager for a child is diagnosed as suffering ‘waterworks problems’; and Henry, suddenly doubtful of his wife’s fidelity, cuts a lock of his sleeping daughter’s hair. The foundations of a world, a family and an identity begin to rock."

Fin qui niente di strano, se lei non fosse una sensitiva assunta dalla Guardia Palatina (l’esercito anti-paranormale del Papa) e lui non fosse il figlio di Dracula, principe di tutto ciò che c’è di oscuro sulla terra. Come se non bastasse, da quando si sono lasciati Lucien ha preso l’irritante abitudine di pedinarla e Alaric Wulf, il più letale (e biondo) ammazza-vampiri in circolazione, sembra convinto che a lei non dispiaccia affatto. Nel frattempo a New York i turisti spariscono senza lasciar traccia, mentre i palatini sono completamente assorbiti da un grandioso evento organizzato al MET dallo sconcertante padre Henrique, un prete giovane e affascinante appena arrivato dal Sud America. La mostra esporrà per la prima volta alcuni inestimabili tesori del Vaticano tra cui, guarda caso, anche un pezzo molto caro al principe delle tenebre. Mentre crescono i sospetti di un possibile collegamento fra l’esposizione e le misteriose sparizioni, Alaric si decide a entrare in azione per scongiurare il peggio… e tentare di strappare una volta per tutte Meena all’oscura malìa del suo ex fidanzato."

		"Description": "How to find out the truth about a crime that was committed sixteen years ago is indeed a problem. No wonder Carla Lemarchant sought the best help available, and it was fortunate for her that she found Hercule Poirot, for as he said himself, “Rest assured—I am the best.” Faced with the question: Did Carla’s mother, Caroline Crale, really commit the murder for which she was sentenced? he began to reconstruct in his mind events long past. She was an enigmatic character, this Caroline Crale, who had pleaded innocent yet had not fought to prove it. Her life with Amyas Crale had been difficult, certainly. He was selfish, quarrelsome, inconsiderate and unfaithful, even though he was a great painter as some said. Approaching deftly and tactfully the other five people involved in the case, Poirot unravels bit by bit the true story of that summer day sixteen years ago. It is a fascinating story which leaves the reader to marvel more than ever at Poirot’s performance and to acclaim Mrs. Christie for yet another brilliant landmark in the history of detective fiction."

The eccentric group who satirised trad jazz, pop and rock, reached Number five with ‘I’m The Urban Spaceman’ in 1968. A punishing schedule of tours and television followed, including work with the future Monty Python team. The following year, broke and burned out, the Bonzos split up, leaving behind a loyal cult following."

		"Book Id": "Vivian launched into myriad solo projects in music, film and theatre, giving himself several nervous breakdowns in the process. His comic masterpiece, ‘Sir Henry at Rawlinson End’, was heard in radio, on an album, and then hit the big screen. Vivian wrote the musical ‘Stinkfoot’, was narrator on ‘Tubular Bells’ and provided lyrics for Steve Winwood. In person, he was just as multi-faceted, by turns the erudite artist and the truculent Teddy Boy, breathtakingly rude. A powerful figure, tall, red-haired and never less than extravagant in his fashion, Vivian Stanshall was a hell-raiser of legendary reputation – ably assisted through much of the 1970s by Who drummer Keith Moon. Vivian drove the many who loved him to the limit, struggling with terrible tranquilliser and alcohol dependency. He died at home in a house fire in 1995. The story of his turbulent life is utterly compelling."

		"Description": "For Grace, the ardent yet puzzled heroine of Andrea Barrett&#8217;s third novel, this trip has been planned as a three-week stay: she&#8217;s to play dutiful wife to Walter, her prominent scientist husband, at the 1986 Beijing International Conference on the Effects of Acid Rain. Walter is twelve years older than Grace, and as sour as the rain he studies; he and Grace are at a particularly troubled point in their marriage. Their tightly circumscribed visit, however, becomes a journey infinitely less tidy and more complex as Grace falls forever out of love with her husband and very much in love with this country and its culture. In the chaos of the Beijing streets and in the home of her new friends Dr. Yu and her son Zaofan, Grace finds the web of life she&#8217;s been too lost to perceive. &#8220;Time you spend in the past and future is time you spend alone,&#8221; Dr. Yu tells her. &#8220;But between them there is a middle kingdom, both feet planted here.&#8221;"

Footsteps is a wonderful exploration of the ties between biographers and their subjects, filled with passion and revelation."

		"Description": "Girls, memory, parenting, millennial fear -- all served Coupland-style. Karen, an attractive, popular student, goes into a coma one night in 1979. Whilst in it, she gives birth to a healthy baby daughter; once out of it, a mere eighteen years later, she finds herself, Rip van Winkle-like, a middle-aged mother whose friends have all gone through all the normal marital, social and political traumas and back again... This tragicomedy shows Coupland in his most mature form yet, writing with all his customary powers of acute observation, but turning his attention away from the surface of modern life to the dynamics of modern relationships, but doing so with all the sly wit and weird accuracy we expect of the soothsaying author of Generation X, Shampoo Planet, Life After God, Microserfs and Polaroids from the Dead."

Helen Vendlers beautifully written book will do precisely this.</p>"

In this surreal, savage and brilliantly funny sequel to Naked Lunch, Burroughss famous cut-up technique, the slicing and random folding in of words, was fully developed, transforming the narrative into an extraordinary, unequalled new form of prose poetry."

		"Description": "The thrillingly dark sequel to New York Times bestseller, DIVERGENT - a major motion picture in 2014. One choice can transform you - or it can destroy you. Tris Priors initiation day should have been marked by victorious celebrations with her chosen faction; instead it ended with unspeakable horrors. Now unrest surges in the factions around her as conflict between their ideologies grows. War seems inevitable; and in times of war sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge and choices will become ever more irrevocable. Tris has already paid a terrible price for survival and is wracked by haunting grief and guilt. But radical new discoveries and shifting relationships mean that she must fully embrace her Divergence - even though she cannot know what might be lost in doing so. New York Times bestselling author Veronica Roths much-anticipated second book of the dystopian Divergent trilogy is another intoxicating thrill-ride, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreak, romance and powerful insights about human nature."

		"Description": "A razor-sharp and achingly funny memoir of the men and movies that shaped one womans life. A unique memoir, Madame Depardieu and the Beautiful Strangers is the story of how a young female film critics love-life is affected and nearly ruined by her obsession with male movie stars. As her increasingly hapless hunt for the right man unfolds and her television and newspaper career unravels, our heroine finally begins to understand that difficult truth: that life is not like the movies. Entwined with the narrative of her real-life love affairs is a kaleidoscope of digressions on great screen actors -- her dream-life with Gerard Depardieu, a personal ad seeking out Tom Cruise, a disastrous climactic encounter with Jeff Bridges. Its a helter skelter ride through love and the movies which reads like a screwball comedy. And the screwball is our heroine, who seems to know everything about movies and the human heart, and nothing about anything else. Written in a fresh and utterly engaging voice, Madame Depardieu and the Beautiful Strangers is both moving and hilarious, a bittersweet and endearingly honest one-off."

Hes been gone almost 20 years now, but nobodys forgotten him. Daveys a local hero, his miracle birth as the seventh son of a seventh son brought fame to this little town and theyve been grateful ever since.

In The Monologue a rich and spoilt woman is consumed with bitterness and loneliness after her son and husband have left home. In The Age of Discretion a scholar faces the harsh rejection of her latest academic work and the waning love of a son more interested in his young wife and her worldly values."

Often we did and hoped, in vain, that wed be able to recall it later. Outspoken, whimsical, outrageous, sheerly funny, deadly serious - you never knew what to expect. Sometimes Myers is our jester, sometimes our conscience, some times red rag to our bull. This book collects and selects from a decade of the Diary to provide, at last, an intriguing taste of Myers."

		"Description": "A cultural and military history of the sniper since 1643, when the first shot was fired by a sniper during the battle for Litchfield in the English Civil War, to the present day, when the sniper has become the embodiment of contemporary military strategy and technology. Since Robert Greville, Lord Brooke, commander of the Parliamentarian forces, was struck in the eye by a marksman positioned on the spire of Litchfield cathedral, the story of the sniper has been one of the gradual empowerment of the individual soldier over the massed battalions. As military technology evolved to produce lighter, and quieter firearms that could strike with accuracy over longer and longer distances, so the role of the talented individual marksman has become more central to the outcome of military conflicts. Andy Dougan tells the story of the sniper as seen in the wars of Vietnam, the first and Second World Wars, the American Civil War, the Boer War and European conflicts and up to the present day when the sniper is not only a battlefield phenomenon but a terrorist in civilian society of almost phantom-like elusiveness. other military history, been the story of individuals: of high profile victims such as the Union General Sedgwick, whose legendary last words were They couldnt hit an elephant at this distance to the celebrated shooters.

Smiths and weavers, masons and quarrymen - all live and work hand in hand with the seasons, the elements and the land. There is a mutual respect and a knowledge of the magical here that somehow, somewhere was lost to us. These fables beautifully recapture and restore it. And a very particular landscape, on the outskirts of industrial Manchester, is brought tangibly to this beautiful books pages."

		"Description": "Noel Browne was one of the key figures in 20th-century Irish politics: a radical in his time, he campaigned for health improvements for women and children back in the 50s, when the Church and Ireland were closely aligned and state intervention in health care was considered going against Church doctrine. As Minister of Health he fell out of favor with official Ireland but became a hero to the Irish people. He was a fascinating figure, fighting poverty and illness, to serve the Irish people. Phyllis Brownes memoir, told with humor, sharp intelligence, and courage, reveals another side to her social revolutionary husband, as well as her own politicians wife tale."

Come to a world distant in time and space, a world where the pace of life is counted by tides of the great River, but where, as in the river itself, there are swift dark currents flowing under a placid surface. Meet Pamra Don--a young woman scarred by her mothers death, lured to a preist-hood where the truth must be hidden from the faithful. And meet Thrasne, a young boatman who trades from town to town, free from the iron control of the towers of the Awakeners, and the priests of the world of the River--free, that is, as long as he never speaks his mind. These two, by design and accident both, are about to discover many truths. And on the Northshore of the River, the truth can kill you."

Her career as a theatre designer takes her from condemned structures in blighted urban towns to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford, and everywhere the casts and staff call her their lucky black cat. But away from the stage Glory is a victim of perversion and abuse, experiences which have dangerously damaged her mind."

We are surrounded here – by unsafe or haunted buildings, by artists and capitalists who flirt with terror, by writers and actresses and the deals they have made with unreality, and by the artificial, utterly constructed, scripted city in which we have agreed to live out a version of living. But there are cracks in the facade, and there are stirrings under the floorboards, and there are animals everywhere you look, if only youd dare to look for them."

In 1915, Bigelow is sent to establish a weather observatory in Anchorage, Alaska, and finds that nothing has prepared him for the loneliness of a railroad town of over two thousand men and only a handful of women, of winter nights twenty hours long. And nothing can protect him from obsession-both with a woman, who seems in her silence and mystery to possess the power to destroy his life forever, and with the weather kite he designs to fly higher than any kite has ever flown before, a kite with which Bigelow plans to penetrate and know not just the sky but the heavens."

The mini cab office was up a cobbled mews with little flat houses either side. Thats where I first met Violet Park, what was left of her. There was a healing centre next door, a pretty smart name for a place with a battered brown door and no proper door handle and stuck-on wooden numbers in the shape of clowns. The 3 of number 13 was a w stuck on sideways and I thought it was kind of sad and I liked it at the same time. Sixteen-year-old Lucas Swain becomes intrigued by the urn of ashes left in a cab office. Convinced that its occupant -- Violet Park -- is communicating with him, he contrives to gain possession of the urn, little realising that his quest will take him on a voyage of self-discovery and identity, forcing him to finally confront what happened to his absent (and possibly dead) father!"

But when someone with money to burn and a penchant for black magic starts tampering with Downsides drug supply, Chess realizes that the unlucky customers are paying with their souls--and taking the innocent with them, as the magic-infused speed compels them to kill in the most gruesome ways possible. As if the streets werent scary enough, the looming war between the two men in her life explodes, taking even more casualties and putting Chess squarely in the middle. Downside could become a literal ghost town if Chess doesnt find a way to stop both the war and the dark wave of death-magic, and the only way to do that is to use both her addiction and her power to enter the spell and chase the magic all the way back to its malevolent source. Too bad that doing so will probably kill Chess--if the war doesnt first destroy the man whos become her reason for living."

Not at all, argues Nick Cohen. We are subject to ever-tightening strictures on what we say, think and do. Privacy laws let the wealthy censor the press; protest against oppression is slammed as bigotry; voices of dissent cant be heard over the clamour hailing the internet as the saviour of democracy. While we seem more informed then ever before, You Cant Read This Book shows that if we want to preserve free speech, we ignore history at our peril."

		"Description": "Few revolutions in science have been more far-reaching—but less understood—than the quantum revolution in physics. Everyday experience cannot prepare us for the sub-atomic world, where quantum effects become all-important. Here, particles can look like waves, and vice versa; electrons seem to lose their identity and instead take on a shifting, unpredictable appearance that depends on how they are being observed; and a single photon may sometimes behave as if it could be in two places at once. In the world of quantum mechanics, uncertainty and ambiguity become not just unavoidable, but essential ingredients of science—a development so disturbing that to Einstein ”it was as if God were playing dice with the universe.” And there is no one better able to explain the quantum revolution as it approaches the century mark than David Lindley. He brings the quantum revolution full circle, showing how the familiar and trustworthy reality of the world around us is actually a consequence of the ineffable uncertainty of the subatomic quantum world—the world we cant see."

		"Description": "A gang of hooded outlaws, a year-long reign of terror, a legendary massacre -- the extraordinary events of the Mitcham Beat War are brought to life in this superb new novel from the Edgar Award-winning author of Poachers. In 1897, in a remote area of Alabama called Mitcham Beat, an aspiring politician is mysteriously murdered. His outraged supporters form the Hell at the Breech gang -- and wage a bloody campaign of retribution that sweeps up the guilty and the innocent alike. Caught in this maelstrom of vengeance are the countys ageing sheriff, the widowed midwife who delivered nearly every member of the gang, a ruthless detective waging a private war, and a young store clerk with a terrible secret. Soaked in the atmosphere of the Deep South, Tom Franklin weaves together historical fact, spare, poised prose and brutal, vivid action to tell a powerful story of ordinary people testing their capacity for good and evil in a harsh and lawless land -- in so doing writing a novel worthy of comparison to the works of William Faulkner, Flannery OConnor and James Dickey."

		"Description": "Jonathan Swift is an infinitely intriguing figure in the literary and political history of England and Ireland. Best known as the author of GULLIVERS TRAVELS, he was an ordained clergyman whose enemies thought did not believe in God. He became a legendary Dean of St Patricks Cathedral in Dublin, whose ambition for church perferment in Englandwas perpetually frustrated. For four short, intoxicating years he was the intimate of Queen Annes chief ministers - a spin-doctor before the term was invented. His private life was intense and enigmatic Two younger women whom he called Stella and Vanessa, moved to Ireland to be close to him. He made both of them unhappy. Poet, polemicist, pamphleteer and wit, Swift is the master of shock. His furious satirical responses to the corruption and hypocrisy he saw around him in public and private life have every relevance for our own artifice and civilisation, gave a new adjective - Swiftian -to the lexicon of criticism. Victoria Glendinning, prize-winning biographer, investigates at close range the main events and relationships of Swifts life, providing a compelling and provocative portrait set in a rich tapestry of controversy and paradox."

		"Description": "The Friendship Tree: The Life and Poems of Davoren Hanna contains selected poems by one of Irelands most remarkable poets, together with a heartfelt - and often painfully honest - memoir of Davoren by his father, journalist Jack Hanna. Born in Dublin in 1975. Davoren was able to control very little of his body, and mute of speech, was assessed as mentally handicapped until age seven. Learning to communicate first by using a letter-board while sitting on his mother, Brighids lap, he began to write poetry which received wide critical acclaim in Ireland and Britain. Davoren Hannas first book, Not Common Speech, was published by Raven Arts Press in 1990, and an RTE television documentary Poised for Flight was made on his life and work. Then in July 1990, his mother Brighid, who cradled him into life and speech, died suddenly, and four years later Davoren, after a series of health crises, died peacefully in his sleep in July 1994."

The last nine months of his diaries are here, in Last Words, and they form a complex, rarely seen, personal portrait of Burroughs at the end of his life, coming to terms with aging and death."

And he waits, and waits some more. How long? he asks a nearby flower, then a shimmering lake, and a long winding path. But nobody seems to know. Little Rabbit begins to think the moon might never come. Curling up, he finally falls asleep, just as a large silvery disc slides silently into the night sky. Arnolds tender illustrations give Little Rabbit and his natural surroundings human-like qualities that children willlove."

Active Readers are designed to make the reading process stimulating and easy. Each book has an exciting and original phonetic-based story on the left hand side and an interactive writing or spelling activity on the right hand side. This unique mix of reading and educational activities makes these Active Readers different to other leading Reader brands on the markets. The design is fresh and clean to ensure accessibility of key reading concepts and beautiful artwork (each title has a different artist to appeal to the different age ranges) makes every book a wonderful learning experience."
